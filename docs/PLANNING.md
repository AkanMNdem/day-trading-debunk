# Project Planning Document

## Current Status

The day-trading-debunk project has a solid foundation with:
- A backtesting engine that can evaluate trading strategies
- Multiple trading strategy implementations (RSI, EMA, VWAP, Buy-and-Hold, Random)
- Data collection from Alpaca API
- Risk management components
- Position sizing algorithms
- Basic performance metrics and visualization

## Tasks To Complete

### Critical Tasks

1. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Add docstrings to all remaining classes and functions
   - [ ] Create a detailed API documentation
   - [ ] Improve README with examples and results

2. **Testing**
   - [ ] Increase test coverage (aim for >80%)
   - [ ] Add more unit tests for risk management components
   - [ ] Add more integration tests for end-to-end workflows

3. **Data Handling**
   - [ ] Add support for more data sources (Yahoo Finance, IEX, etc.)
   - [ ] Implement caching mechanism for API data
   - [ ] Support for different timeframes (daily, weekly, monthly)

4. **Strategy Improvements**
   - [ ] Implement parameter optimization for strategies
   - [ ] Add more sophisticated strategies (ML-based, multi-factor)
   - [ ] Add strategy combination capabilities

### Enhancement Tasks

5. **Visualization**
   - [ ] Create interactive dashboard for results (using Dash or Streamlit)
   - [ ] Add more detailed charts (trade entries/exits, drawdown periods)
   - [ ] Generate PDF reports of backtests

6. **Performance**
   - [ ] Optimize data processing for large datasets
   - [ ] Add parallel processing for multiple backtests
   - [ ] Implement vectorized calculations where possible

7. **Risk Management**
   - [ ] Add more sophisticated risk metrics (VaR, Expected Shortfall)
   - [ ] Implement portfolio-level risk management
   - [ ] Add margin/leverage simulation

8. **User Experience**
   - [ ] Create a CLI interface for running backtests
   - [ ] Add configuration file support
   - [ ] Implement progress bars for long-running operations

## Future Directions

1. **Real-time Trading**
   - Connect to broker APIs for paper/live trading
   - Implement real-time signal generation
   - Add monitoring and alerting systems

2. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Incorporate machine learning for strategy improvement
   - Implement walk-forward optimization
   - Add strategy robustness testing (Monte Carlo simulations)

3. **Community Features**
   - Create a web interface for sharing and comparing strategies
   - Implement a strategy marketplace
   - Add social features (comments, ratings, following)

## Timeline

### Short-term (1-2 months)
- Complete all critical tasks
- Publish initial results and findings

### Medium-term (3-6 months)
- Complete enhancement tasks
- Begin implementing real-time trading capabilities

### Long-term (6+ months)
- Implement advanced analytics
- Develop community features
